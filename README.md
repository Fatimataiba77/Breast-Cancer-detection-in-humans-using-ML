# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning  

## 🌟 Description  
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving survival rates. This project applies machine learning techniques to classify tumors as benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) using medical data.  

By leveraging classification algorithms and analyzing key tumor characteristics, this model helps in automating cancer detection, assisting healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses.  



## 📌 Features  
- 🔬 Data Preprocessing – Handles missing values and normalizes data.  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizes tumor characteristics and patterns.  
- 🤖 Machine Learning Models – Implements algorithms like **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM**.  
- 🎯 Model Evaluation – Uses **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score** to measure performance.
